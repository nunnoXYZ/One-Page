		Welcome to demo page 3. Here we see a picture of a drunk cat 
		(which is totally 100% not at all staged... *shifty eyes*).
	</p>
	<p>
		You\'ll see that along with the url and webpage content, the title has also been updated.
		Using PJAX you can even give pages custom titles, for example

		<a href="page2.php" data-title="Custom title!">this link</a>
		 will open page 2  with the title "Custom title!".
